                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African artiodactyl mammal and the tallest living terrestrial animal. It is known for its long neck, long legs, and distinctive coat patterns with patches of brown on a light background. There are several subspecies of giraffe, each with slightly different coat patterns and ranges.</p>
<p>Giraffes inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands across Africa. They primarily feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits of woody plants, especially acacia species, using their long necks and prehensile tongues to reach high branches. Despite their size, giraffes are gentle animals and live in loose social groups known as towers.</p>
<p>Male giraffes can reach heights of up to 5.5 m (18 ft), while females are slightly shorter. Their long legs allow them to cover large distances when searching for food or water, and their necks are used in "necking" battles during mating rituals.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen G14, near the observation deck.</p>
