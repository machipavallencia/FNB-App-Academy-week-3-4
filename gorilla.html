                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas (Gorilla spp.) are the largest living primates, known for their strength, intelligence, and gentle nature. There are two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, each with distinct subspecies. Gorillas are herbivorous and live in family groups led by a dominant silverback male.</p>
<p>They inhabit the tropical forests of central Africa, including lowland swamps, montane forests, and bamboo forests. Gorillas primarily feed on leaves, stems, fruit, and shoots. They are highly intelligent animals, capable of using tools, communicating through complex vocalizations, and displaying a range of emotions.</p>
<p>Gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and diseases like Ebola. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitats and preventing human-wildlife conflicts.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas at pen G07, deep within the forest exhibit area.</p>
