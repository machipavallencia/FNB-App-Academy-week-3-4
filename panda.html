                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear species native to China, known for its distinctive black and white fur. Pandas are primarily herbivorous, with bamboo making up about 99% of their diet, although they occasionally eat other plants or small animals. They have a unique wrist bone that functions as an opposable thumb, helping them grasp bamboo stalks.</p>
<p>Pandas are solitary animals that live in temperate mountain forests with dense understories of bamboo. They have a slow reproductive rate, with females typically giving birth to one cub every two years. Despite their size, pandas are excellent climbers and can swim well.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and low birth rates, giant pandas were once considered endangered. Thanks to conservation efforts, their status has improved, but they remain vulnerable and protected by law.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the pandas at pen P18, in the bamboo grove area.</p>
