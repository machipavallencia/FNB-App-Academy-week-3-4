                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous feline native to Africa and parts of Asia. Known as the "king of the savannah," lions are powerful predators with strong muscular builds, large heads, and manes in males. They are the only cats that live in social groups called prides, which consist of related females, their offspring, and a few males.</p>
<p>Lions are primarily found in grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands where prey is abundant. They are apex predators, hunting animals such as antelopes, zebras, and buffalo. Lions are known for their cooperative hunting strategies and their loud roars, which can be heard up to 8 km away.</p>
<p>Males can weigh up to 250 kg (550 lb), while females are smaller. Lions spend much of their day resting, conserving energy for their hunts, which typically occur at night or early morning.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the lions at pen L05, near the main entrance.</p>
