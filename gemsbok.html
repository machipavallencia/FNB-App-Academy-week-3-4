                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a striking antelope species native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari Desert. Known for their elegant appearance and impressive horns, gemsboks are well-adapted to surviving in harsh desert conditions with minimal water.</p>
    <p>Gemsboks have a distinctive black-and-white facial pattern, long straight horns (reaching up to 85 cm), and a tan-colored body with black and white markings on their legs and underbelly. Both males and females have horns, which they use for defense against predators and during territorial disputes.</p>
    <p>These herbivores primarily feed on grasses, herbs, and shrubs, and they can survive by extracting moisture from the plants they eat, allowing them to go for long periods without drinking water. They are mostly active during the cooler hours of the day to conserve energy.</p>
    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen G10, close to the desert habitat display in the park.</p>
